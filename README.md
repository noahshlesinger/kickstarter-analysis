# An Anaylis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Louise has a play she wants to get funded through a kickstarter campaign with an estimated monetary requirement 4000 pounds and needs to understand what makes a campaign successful. 

### The purpose of this document is to outline pertinent trends in previous kickstarter campaigns to aid Louise in meeting her funding goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first important question to answer is *when* Louise should initiate her kickstarter campaign. The following chart demonstrates not only when kickstarters are typically started throughout the months of the year but also includes whether or not it was successful, a failure, or canceled before completion. To make this more relevant to Louise's particular interest in theater related campaigns, the data has been filtered to only include those such campaigns.

All the data used in this report is taken from a spreadhsheet (
[Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](https://github.com/noahshlesinger/kickstarter-analysis/files/7803645/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx))  containing over 4000 kickstarter campaigns with varoius data points such as date of launch, funding goal, pledged amount, outcomes, etc. 

As is evident, the number of canceled campaings is relaitively low throughout the year while failed and successful campaigns show an increase in the summer months. By looking at the failed and successful campaigns together, it becomes clear that the most popular time of to start a campaign is in those summer months, specifically in June. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Another important factor to consider when Louise is creating her campaign is whether or not her funding goal is reasonable. The chart below represents the number of successful and failed campaigns categorized into funding goal in increments of roughly $5,000 starting at $1,000. Again, having data on all campaigns could lead to a inaccurate conclusion given Louise's specific focus on theater. The data here has been filtered to only represent kickstarter campaigns for plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
